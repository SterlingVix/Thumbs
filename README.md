# Thumbs #

<!-- 

There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for each heading. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

<h2>Your microphone is better - use it!</h2>
Thumbs allows you to use the microphone already on your Apple or Android phone to communicate with a classroom speaker system.

<h3>Losing your voice</h3>
Student participation in classroom settings is, by many metrics, beneficial for learning. As classroom sizes increase and go online, student voices are harder to hear. Literally.
Passing around microphones is one solution. But it's a bad solution.

<h3>Using your thumbs</h3>
Thumbs uses the microphones students already carry with them on their Apple and Android phones to communicate with classroom speakers.
They'll use their thumbs to do this. Hence the name.


<h3>What real people are really saying. Really.</h3>
"Thumbs works. It makes sound. And it uses thumbs. But I still hate teaching."
   --- Professor Bummer

<h3>How to Get Started</h3>
Thumbs is so easy to use, even students can't mess it up.*
Thumbs users must simply navigate to the web page provided by their instructor to activate the app. When a user presses and holds the microphone icon, they can speak into their phone. Thumbs does the rest!

<h3>Customer Quote</h3>
"I use thumbs to ask questions. But I also use it to tap out sick rhythms on the classroom speakers. My teacher hates that, but I don't care about feelings."
   --- Basically everybody

<h2>Use your thumbs, find your voice</h2>



*NOTE: Students can mess it up.
